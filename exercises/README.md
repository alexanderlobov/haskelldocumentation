# Haskell Exercises
This is a collection of exercises for learning Haskell. Each exercise comes with tests for verifying your solution.

I suggest you do the exercises in this order:
* [Functions](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/haskelldocumentation/blob/master/exercises/Functions/Functions.hs)
* [Maybe](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/haskelldocumentation/blob/master/exercises/Maybe/Maybe.hs)
* [PatternMatching](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/haskelldocumentation/blob/master/exercises/PatternMatching/PatternMatching.hs)
* [Recursion](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/haskelldocumentation/blob/master/exercises/Recursion/Recursion.hs)
* [RecursionSchemes](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/haskelldocumentation/blob/master/exercises/RecursionSchemes/RecursionSchemes.hs)
* [UpdateRecords](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/haskelldocumentation/blob/master/exercises/UpdateRecords/UpdateRecords.hs)
* [HigherOrderFunctions](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/haskelldocumentation/blob/master/exercises/HigherOrderFunctions/HigherOrderFunctions.hs)
* [QuickCheck](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/haskelldocumentation/blob/master/exercises/QuickCheck/QuickCheck.hs)
* [LogParser](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/haskelldocumentation/blob/master/exercises/LogParser/LogParser.hs)
* [ProjectEuler](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/haskelldocumentation/blob/master/exercises/ProjectEuler/ProjectEuler.hs)
* [TextCalculator](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/haskelldocumentation/blob/master/exercises/TextCalculator/TextCalculator.hs)
* [Regex](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/haskelldocumentation/blob/master/exercises/Regex/Regex.hs)
* [BinTree](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/haskelldocumentation/blob/master/exercises/BinTree/BinTree.hs)
* [Vigenere](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/haskelldocumentation/blob/master/exercises/Vigenere/Vigenere.hs)

You are free to use these exercises in workshops and other learning material.

It's all a bit rough around the edges and pull requests are most welcome :)

## Getting started
* Install [Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack)
* Clone this repo
* Inside the `exercises` directory, run `stack setup` once to install GHC
* To build and run the tests: `stack test` (or `stack test --file-watch` if you want to rerun the tests automatically after making a change)
